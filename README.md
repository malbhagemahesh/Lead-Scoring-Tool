# Lead Scoring & Prioritization Tool (Caprae Capital Pre-Work)

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Problem We Solve**

The challenge with lead generation tools is that they often deliver a high *volume* of data without a clear way to determine which leads are worth a sales team's time. Our primary goal is to turn raw data into **actionable intelligence.**

This tool is a high-impact enhancement for any lead generation platform, allowing sales teams to **focus exclusively on high-potential targets** that align with Caprae Capitalâ€™s investment strategy.

## âœ¨ **The Solution: Intelligent Lead Prioritization**

This tool assigns two crucial metrics to every lead:

### 1. **Lead Score (0-100):** *How valuable is the company?*
This score determines the overall quality and potential of a lead based on criteria that matter to the business.

* **Customizable Weights:** Sales leaders can dynamically adjust the importance of key factors like **Company Size**, **Estimated Revenue**, **Engagement Signals** (e.g., recent funding), and **Contact Title Relevance** (e.g., CEO vs. Manager) to instantly align the prioritization with the current sales strategy.
* **Result:** Ensures the sales team is chasing the companies most likely to result in a deal.

### 2. **Confidence Score (0-100):** *How actionable is the lead?*
This metric assesses the reliability and completeness of the contact information.

* **Focus on Completeness:** It measures the presence of key contact points (Email, Phone, LinkedIn URL).
* **Result:** Reduces wasted time by ensuring the team only contacts leads with verifiable and complete data, acting as a built-in data quality and validation feature (bonus point feature).
